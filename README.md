* docs: changes to documentation
* style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
* refactor: refactoring production code

#### The Subject
Subjects should be no greater than 50 characters, should begin with a capital letter and do not end with a period.

Use an imperative tone to describe what a commit does, rather than what it did. For example, use change; not changed or changes.
